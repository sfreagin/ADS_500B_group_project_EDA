### Very light Exploratory Data Analysis files for open sharing and inspiration

Hi all, this is a series of very light EDA files from the group project for ADS 500B Data Science Programming. The repository consists of 3 Jupyter Notebooks, one corresponding to each of the potential datasets from which we're allowed to choose.
1. EDA1.pynb - banking information
2. EDA2.pynb - housing information
3. EDA3.pynb - online shopping information

#### This is NOT a substitute for your own due diligence and EDA!

I only want to share code that will inspire people and possibly raise the overall coding standards for our cohort. Most importantly:
* I have NOT cleaned the data in any way
* All charts are a first-pass attempt for seeing how the data is structured

I do not believe sharing this information with the class is in any way a violation of the USD Student Code of Ethics, but please let me know if you think otherwise and I will address those concerns ASAP.
